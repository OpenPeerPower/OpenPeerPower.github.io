I"<p>Particulate matter sensors measure the amount of very small particles in the air. A short introduction how these sensors work can be found on <a href="https://www.open-homeautomation.com/2016/07/19/measuring-air-quality/">Open Power Management</a>.</p>
<p>Cheap LED based sensors usually use a GPIO interface that is hard to attach to computers. However, there are a lot of laser LED based sensors on the market that use a serial interface and can be <a href="https://www.open-homeautomation.com/2016/07/20/connecting-an-particulate-matter-sensor-to-your-pc-or-mac/">connected to your Open Peer Power system easily with an USB to serial converter</a>.</p>
