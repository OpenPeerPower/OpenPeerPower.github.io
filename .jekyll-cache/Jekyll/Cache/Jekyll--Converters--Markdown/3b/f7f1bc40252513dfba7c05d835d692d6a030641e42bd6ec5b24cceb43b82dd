I"¨<p>For the 4th edition, I thought it fitted to devote the community highlights to 3D!</p>
<p><em>That is actually a lie, the <a href="/blog/2020/02/19/community-highlights/">3rd edition</a>
would have been much more fitting, but was hijacked by Paulus ;)
At least itâ€™s my 3rd community highlight writeup, so that counts, right?</em></p>
<p>Ready for some highly inspiring and mind-blowing 3D creations?</p>
<h2>3D home navigation and control, using Unity</h2>
<p>Are you sure you ready? Because Harrie de Groot created a fully navigatable
3D model of his home using Unity, accessible from within Open Peer Power.</p>
<p>You really <strong>need</strong> to watch the video below nowâ€¦</p>

<p>Well done, Harrie! That looks slick!</p>
<p>More details on his creation can be found on the
<a href="https://community.openpeerpower.io/t/3d-home-navigation-control-unity-open-peer-power/174972">Open Peer Power Community Forum</a>.</p>
<h2>3D printed interactive floorplan</h2>
<p>If you have been around a bit, you might have come across a screenshot of
someone with an interactive floorplan in Open Peer Power. <a href="https://twitter.com/rynam0">Ryan Connolly</a>
took that idea straight into the real world by 3D printing his floorplan,
wired it, and hooked it up Open Peer Power.</p>
<p>Talking about taking things into another dimensionâ€¦</p>

<h3>Getting started with your own 3D floorplan</h3>
<p>Ok, so the above two, rather impressive, listings might be a bit out of reach
for the most of us. Still, with some help, you could still achieve some pretty
nice looking 3D floorplans. <a href="https://github.com/boralyl">Aaron Godfrey</a> wrote a
couple of excellent blog posts on this.</p>
<p>In his <a href="https://aarongodfrey.dev/home%20automation/floorplan-in-open-peer-power/">first blog post</a>,
Aaron shows you what his floorplan looks like</p>

</div>
<p>He followed up with two blog posting on how to achieve this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://aarongodfrey.dev/home%20automation/tips_for_creating_a_3d_floorplan_using_sweethome3d/">Tips for creating a Floorplan in Sweet Home 3D</a></li>
<li><a href="https://aarongodfrey.dev/home%20automation/creating-a-3d-floorplan-in-open-peer-power/">Creating an Interactive 3D Floorplan in Open Peer Power</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus tip: HomeByMe</h3>
<p>Iâ€™ve personally got recommended a tool for creating a 3D floorplan with a tool
that is generally lesser-known, but actually pretty awesome! <a href="https://home.by.me/en/">HomeByMe</a></p>
<img src='/images/blog/2020-02-28-community-highlights/homebyme.png' alt='Screenshot of HomeByMe.' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;'>
<p>This is a result of a 3D floorplan created with <a href="https://home.by.me/en/">HomeByMe</a>.</p>
<p>It works fully in the browser and I enjoyed the experience using that.
So credits where credits due: Thanks for recommending me this sweet little
gem <a href="https://www.twitter.com/andreadonno">Andrea Donno</a>!</p>
