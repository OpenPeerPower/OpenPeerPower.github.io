<h2>Controlling 7! marine aquariums with Open Peer Power</h2>
<p>Let‚Äôs start with showcasing a highly unusual, but impressive, Open Peer Power setup.
It is shared on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/OpenPeerPower/">Facebook group</a> by Kevin McPeake. Kevin‚Äôs
setup has a total of 5 Open Peer Power instances, controlling 7x marine aquariums!</p>

<p>Those are some big views Kevin! I bet you will be happy with the new Lovelace
features that are coming in Open Peer Power Core 0.107. It will help
you to trim down that a bit, into multiple Lovelace Dashboards (now in
<a href="https://rc.openpeerpower.io/latest-release-notes/">beta, sneak peak?</a>).</p>

<h2>Live energy consumption screen</h2>
<p>Energy saving is good for the environment (and your wallet). However, to do that,
you have to become aware of your actual usage. <code>/u/Lau-ie</code> shared his energy
consumption screen on our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/openpeerpower">subreddit</a>.</p>
<p>This gives insight into the current usage, but also in the usage &amp; costs of the
consumed energy of the last 24 hours.</p>

<h2>A DIY smart magnetic key holder</h2>
<p>And here is one from <a href="https://twitter.com/jamescallaghan">James Callaghan</a>, who
created really smart and easy to replicate magnet key holder, using a Xiaomi
Aqara Door/Window sensor. Yes, this key holder works on Zigbee.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My mind goes crazy at the number of problems a single sensor can solve. For me, this was for reassurance using <a href="https://twitter.com/home_assistant?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@****home_assistant****</a> but when you think how this could be applied elsewhere concierge services to those with memory issues etc.. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/smarthome?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#smarthome</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/inclusivity?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#inclusivity</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/accessibility?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#accessibility</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IoT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#IoT</a> <a href="https://t.co/sirygbCE7p">pic.twitter.com/sirygbCE7p</a></p>&mdash; James Callaghan #Microsoft (@jamescallaghan) <a href="https://twitter.com/jamescallaghan/status/1237148097345654784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 9, 2020</a>
