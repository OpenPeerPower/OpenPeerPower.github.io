<p>Before we talk about anything that matches the title of this blog post:</p>
<p>On behalf of everybody working on the Open Peer Power project, we hope you, your
family and loved ones are safe and remain healthy during this pandemic.
Our thoughts are with everyone that has been deeply affected by the current situation.</p>
<p>Stay strong, keep distance from each other, wash your hands and stay safe.</p>
<p>‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
<p>We made it all up to 0.107.7 the previous release, 7! patch releases.</p>
<p>Some have noticed and commented on the fact we do a lot more patch releases
the past months, which is correct. This is not because everything was shipped
in a broken state, but we are trying to ship <strong>any</strong> bug fix to you as soon as
possible! Just so you don‚Äôt have to wait 3 weeks for something to get fixed.</p>
<p>So let‚Äôs talk about the elephant in the room: Open Peer Power Core 0.108!</p>
<h2>Martin Hjelmare &amp; Ashton Lafferty join Nabu Casa</h2>
<p>We want to start by announcing <a href="https://github.com/MartinHjelmare">Martin Hjelmare</a>
has joined <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com">Nabu Casa</a>!</p>
<p>Martin is a core team member for a long time, and initially started out
contributing to the project by his work on the
<a href="https://www.openpeerpower.io/integrations/mysensors/">MySensors</a> integration
back in <a href="https://www.openpeerpower.io/blog/2016/01/17/extended-support-for-diy-solutions/">Open Peer Power 0.11</a>
(2016)! Most contributors to Open Peer Power, will know Martin for his endless
patience on the incredible code reviews he does.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Ashton Lafferty (cogneato) has been working some hours for
Nabu Casa, to help out with things like support. Most of you probably know him
from that already, as he is very active in helping out on our
<a href="/join-chat">Discord server</a>.</p>
<p>We are happy to announce that Ashton will now join Nabu Casa full-time as well!</p>
<p>Congratulations Martin and Ashton! üéâ</p>
<h2>Integration logos &amp; icons</h2>
<p>We have created a <a href="https://github.com/OpenPeerPower/brands">new repository</a>
on GitHub containing all the brand icons and logos Open Peer Power is able to
integrate with. These images are, for example, used in our documentation.</p>
<p>In 0.108, we made a start on using the content from this repository in the
Open Peer Power frontend. The device information page got a layout update and
the integrations page as well.</p>
<p>These pages will now show the icons and logos matching the integration.</p>
<p class='img'>

<p>Looking for a way to contribute to the Open Peer Power project?
We still are missing a lot of images; So we are
<a href="https://github.com/OpenPeerPower/brands/issues">calling out for help</a>!</p>
<h2>Many integrations now available to set up from the UI</h2>
<p>It is absolutely amazing to see all the upgraded integrations this release!
Many contributors have gone out and added support to a lot of integrations
to allow them to be configured via the Open Peer Power frontend.</p>
<p>Not all of them were ready in time for this release; nevertheless, the list is
amazing already:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/integrations/freebox/">Freebox</a>, done by <a href="https://github.com/Quentame">@Quentame</a></li>
<li><a href="/integrations/monoprice/">Monoprice</a>, done by <a href="https://github.com/OnFreund">@OnFreund</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Yes, <a href="https://github.com/bdraco">@bdraco</a> has been on fire this release! Amazing job!</p>
<h2>Lovelace Map history</h2>
<p>Maybe not very useful during home quarantine, but a very cool feature for when
we are allowed to get out of our homes again.
<a href="https://github.com/Hoytron">@Hoytron</a> added the ability to show the history of
persons or device trackers on the Lovelace map card. You can define how many hours of history
you want to show and it will draw lines between all the points in that
time frame.</p>

<h2>New Lovelace card: Entity</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zsarnett">@zsarnett</a> added a new Lovelace card, the entity card. This card looks like the sensor card, but allows you to use any entity (not just sensors).</p>

</p>
<h2>Area configuration page</h2>
<p>We added an overview page for your areas. On this page you can see all the devices in the area, but also the automations, scenes and scripts that affect that area.</p>

<h2>Horizontal stack now handles different heights better</h2>
<p>When creating a Horizontal stack, the cards in the stack don‚Äôt always line up
nicely. This has been adjusted. Horizontal stacks now deal better with the
difference in heights of the cards on the stack.</p>

<h2>Other noteworthy changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em><strong>‚ÄúAlexa, show the front door camera.‚Äù</strong></em> üò≤<br />
<a href="/integrations/alexa/">Alexa</a> now has support for Cameras, thanks <a href="https://github.com/ochlocracy">@ochlocracy</a>!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selecting your default Lovelace dashboard has been moved to the user
profile page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lot of configuration pages are migrated to data tables, this means you can
now search in your automations, scenes, scripts, users and areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lovelace cards in panel views can now also be edited with the UI editor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The graph from the sensor card is now also available as a footer for the
entities and entity card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Markdown card has a new <code>user</code> variable that can be used to display the
currently logged in user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the ZHA Zigbee integration, Zigbee groups now dynamically create
entities for lights, switches and fans that are grouped together. This
enables near-simultaneous control over a large group of lights allowing
them to turn on or off at the exact same time. Thank you <a href="https://github.com/dmulcahey">@dmulcahey</a>!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cameras added using the <a href="/integrations/onvif/">ONVIF</a> integration now automatically
use the still images provided by the camera, instead of Open Peer Power
generating one. Nice work <a href="https://github.com/roleoroleo">@roleoroleo</a>!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/integrations/wled/">WLED</a> got quite a few internal upgrades, has added new Wi-Fi
sensors and now has a service to control the effects of your WLED device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Docker images for Open Peer Power are now using Jemalloc, to reduce memory
fragmentation and speed up memory allocation. So, less memory and generally
a faster Open Peer Power.</p>
</li>
</ul>
