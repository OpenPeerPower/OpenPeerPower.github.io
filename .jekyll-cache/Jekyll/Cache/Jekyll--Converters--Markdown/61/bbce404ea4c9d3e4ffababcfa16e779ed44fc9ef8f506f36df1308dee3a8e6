I"<	<p>The action of an automation rule is what is being executed when a rule fires. The action part follows the <a href="/docs/scripts/">script syntax</a> which can be used to interact with anything via services or events. For services you can specify the entity_id that it should apply to and optional service parameters (to specify for example the brightness).</p>
<p>You can also call the service to activate <a href="/integrations/scene/">a scene</a> which will allow you to define how you want your devices to be and have Open Peer Power call the right services.</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">automation:
  # Change the light in the kitchen and living room to 150 brightness and color red.
  trigger:
    platform: sun
    event: sunset
  action:
    service: light.turn_on
    data:
      brightness: 150
      rgb_color: [255, 0, 0]
      entity_id:
        - light.kitchen
        - light.living_room
automation 2:
  # Notify me on my mobile phone of an event
  trigger:
    platform: sun
    event: sunset
    offset: -00:30
  action:
    # Actions are scripts so can also be a list of actions
    - service: notify.notify
      data:
        message: Beautiful sunset!
    - delay: 0:35
    - service: notify.notify
      data:
        message: Oh wow you really missed something great.</code></pre></figure>
<p>Conditions can also be part of an action. You can combine multiple service calls and conditions in a single action, and they will be processed in the order you put them in. If the result of a condition is false, the action will stop there so any service calls after that condition will not be executed.</p>
