I"/<p>Almost all integrations have external dependencies to communicate with your devices and services. Sometimes Open Peer Power is unable to install the necessary dependencies. If this is the case, it should show up in <code>open-peer-power.log</code>.</p>
<p>The first step is trying to restart Open Peer Power and see if the problem persists. If it does, look at the log to see what the error is. If you canâ€™t figure it out, please <a href="https://github.com/OpenPeerPower/Open-Peer-Power/issues">report it</a> so we can investigate what is going on.</p>
