I"k<p>The <code>heatmiser</code> climate platform let you control <a href="https://www.heatmisershop.co.uk/room-thermostats/">Heatmiser DT/DT-E/PRT/PRT-E</a> thermostats from Heatmiser. The module itself is currently setup to work over a RS232 -&gt; RS485 converter, therefore it connects over IP.</p>
<p>Further work would be required to get this setup to connect over Wi-Fi, but the HeatmiserV3 Python module being used is a full implementation of the V3 protocol.</p>
<p>To set it up, add the following information to your <code>configuration.yaml</code> file:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">climate:
  - platform: heatmiser
    host: YOUR_IP_ADDRESS
    port: YOUR_PORT
    tstats:
      - id: THERMOSTAT_ID
        name: THERMOSTAT_NAME</code></pre></figure>
<p>A single interface can handle up to 32 connected devices.</p>
