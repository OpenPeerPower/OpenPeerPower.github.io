I"¶<p>Groups allow the user to combine multiple entities into one.</p>
<p>Check the <strong>States</strong> <img src='/images/screenshots/developer-tool-states-icon.png' class='no-shadow' height='38' /> page from the <strong>Developer Tools</strong> and browse the <strong>Current entities:</strong> listing for all available entities.</p>

group:
  kitchen:
    name: Kitchen
    entities:

<h2>Group behavior</h2>
<p>By default when any member of a group is <code>on</code> then the group will also be <code>on</code>. Similarly with a device tracker, when any member of the group is <code>home</code> then the group is <code>home</code>. If you set the <code>all</code> option to <code>true</code> though, this behavior is inverted and all members of the group have to be <code>on</code> for the group to turn on as well.</p>
