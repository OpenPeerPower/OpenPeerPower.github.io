I"4<p>Conditions are an optional part of an automation rule and can be used to prevent an action from happening when triggered. When a condition does not return true, the automation will stop executing. Conditions look very similar to triggers but are very different. A trigger will look at events happening in the system while a condition only looks at how the system looks right now. A trigger can observe that a switch is being turned on. A condition can only see if a switch is currently on or off.</p>
<p>The available conditions for an automation are the same as for the script syntax so see that page for a <a href="/docs/scripts/conditions/">full list of available conditions</a>.</p>
<p>Example of using condition:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">automation:
- alias: &#39;Enciende Despacho&#39;
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.mini_despacho
    to: &#39;on&#39;
  condition:
    condition: or
    conditions:
      - condition: template
        value_template: &quot;{{ state_attr(&#39;sun.sun&#39;, &#39;elevation&#39;) &lt; 4 }}&quot;
      - condition: template
        value_template: &quot;{{ states(&#39;sensor.sensorluz_7_0&#39;) &lt; 10 }}&quot;
  action:
    - service: scene.turn_on
      entity_id: scene.DespiertaDespacho</code></pre></figure>
