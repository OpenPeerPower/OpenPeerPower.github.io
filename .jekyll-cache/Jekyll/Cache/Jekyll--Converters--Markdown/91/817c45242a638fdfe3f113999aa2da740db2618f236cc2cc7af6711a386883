I";<p>Over the last week, we’ve released some awesome new features and improvements to Open Peer Power Companion for Android. I wanted to take a moment to highlight some of the recent things that we introduced in 1.6 and 1.7.</p>
<h2>Actionable notifications</h2>
<p>Now you can define action buttons to attach to a notification dynamically. When you click one of those buttons, an event is fired back to Open Peer Power so you can take action based on the button chosen.</p>
<p>Here’s an example to check with a user if they want to close the garage door after it has been left open for 30 minutes:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">automation:
  - alias: Notify apps when the garage door opens
    trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: cover.garage_door
      from: &#39;closed&#39;
      to: &#39;open&#39;
      for: ‘0:30:00’
    action:
      service: notify.mobile_app_robbies_pixel_5
      data:
        message: &quot;The garage has been left open&quot;
        data:
          image: https://www.openpeerpower.io/images/merchandise/shirt-frontpage.png
          actions:
            - action: &quot;close_garage&quot; # The key you are sending for the event
              title: &quot;Close Garage Door&quot; # The button title
<ul>
<li>alias: Close the garage when notification action is tapped
trigger:
platform: event
event_type: mobile_app_notification_action
event_data:
action: close_garage
action:
service: cover.close_cover
entity_id: cover.garage_door</code></pre></figure></li>
</ul>
<p>After adding these automations, whenever your garage door remains open for 30 minutes, your device will get a notification that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2020-02-android-16-17-release/garage.png" alt="A notification showing an open garage" /></p>
<p>When you press that close garage button… your garage will close!</p>
<p>We are planning to expand notifications over the next few versions to continue to match the existing functionality available in the iOS app. That includes things like sending text back to Open Peer Power and critical alerts.</p>
<h2>Requesting location updates via notification</h2>
<p>You can now send a notification with just the message <code>request_location_update</code> and once it reaches your device, it will update its current location in Open Peer Power. Be careful using this too much though, as it can drain your battery.</p>
<h2>Sensors</h2>
<p>New in version 1.7, we have added the first sensors to the app. For now, you will find the following new sensors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Battery percentage</li>
<li>Battery state</li>
<li>Current Wi-Fi network information</li>
</ul>
<p>We plan to keep expanding sensors in the near future to add things like cellular status and more.</p>
<h2>Docs</h2>
<p>Thanks to a few dedicated volunteers and a mad dash, <a href="https://companion.openpeerpower.io/">we have a newly refreshed docs website</a>. It’s using the latest version of <a href="https://docusaurus.io/">Docusaurus</a>, which means it’s got a new coat of paint and even dark mode support. So much easier on the eyes!</p>
<p>In addition to the tooling updates, we’ve also begun documenting Android and iOS differences. Keep an eye out for the Android and Apple logos to denote what works where.</p>
<p>Over time we plan to bring Android and iOS as close together, in terms of features and the ways they interact with Open Peer Power, as much as possible. To allow using both platforms in the same way, so that users who are using both platforms, or switching platforms, can use them without any modifications.</p>
<h2>Finale</h2>
<p>In addition to the highlights above, we’ve also killed an impressive amount of bugs. Thanks goes to <a href="https://github.com/JBassett">JBassett</a>, <a href="https://github.com/KBerstene">KBerstene</a>, <a href="https://github.com/quthla">quthla</a> and <a href="https://github.com/neopilou">neopilou</a> for their work on all of the above.</p>
<p>Enjoy the new release! Don’t forget to leave a rating if you like the app, it will help other users find the app.</p>
