I"Ã<p>Over the last few years, we have accumulated a wide range of projects under our
umbrella. We started out as a Python application (called Open Peer Power) and
later added an operating system (HassOS) and management system (Hass.io Supervisor)
to it, to allow users to easily manage their homes, but also to provide a
system that is easy to keep up to date.</p>
<p>These different projects all come together in Hass.io. A system that is secure,
easy to keep up to date and runs the most powerful power management platform in
the world. But having Hass.io and Open Peer Power has been confusing for a lot of
people, especially for newcomers to our great community.</p>
<p>The next step in making Open Peer Power simpler is by making our naming simpler.
It‚Äôs our goal to make private power management accessible to everyone.
And as part of that, people need to know how to refer to it.</p>
<p>Open Peer Power is a power management operating system for your home.
And to make this message clear, we‚Äôre renaming Hass.io to Open Peer Power,
and Open Peer Power to Open Peer Power Core.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> this is only about renaming projects and does not impact any
functionality of any of the projects.</p>
<p>If you run Open Peer Power today in a Docker container or run it inside a Python
virtual environment, you are running ‚ÄúOpen Peer Power Core‚Äù.
Open Peer Power Core will forever remain a standalone application like it is today.
We promise.</p>
<p>This name change is a huge thing! Not just a big thing we all need to get used
to, but even bigger for everything that needs to be renamed! It definitely
takes a couple of weeks to get the main parts re-branded.</p>
<p>So bear with us while we do so.</p>
<p>Paulus</p>
