I"„<p>This offers a map on the frontend to display the location of tracked devices. To set up tracked devices, look at the <a href="/integrations/device_tracker/">device tracker</a> documentation. This integration is by default enabled, unless youâ€™ve disabled or removed the <a href="https://www.openpeerpower.io/integrations/default_config/"><code>default_config:</code></a> line from your configuration. If that is the case, the following example shows you how to enable this integration manually:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"># Example configuration.yaml entry
map:</code></pre></figure>
<div class='note'>
Devices that are currently at home won't show on the map.

<div class='note'>
This map always shows the location of all tracked devices. If you want to hide certain entities, you should look into the [Map Card](/lovelace/map).
