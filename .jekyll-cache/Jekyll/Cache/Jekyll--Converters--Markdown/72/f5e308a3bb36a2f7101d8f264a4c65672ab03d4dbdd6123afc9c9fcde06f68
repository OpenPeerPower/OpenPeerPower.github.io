<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The <code>bmw_connected_drive</code> integration offers several services. In case you need to provide the vehicle identification number (VIN) as a parameter, you can see the VIN in the attributes of the device tracker for the vehicle. The VIN is a 17 digit alphanumeric string, e.g., <code>WBANXXXXXX1234567</code>.</p>
<p>Using these services will impact the state of your vehicle. So use these services with care!</p>
<h3>Locking and unlocking</h3>
<p>The vehicle can be locked and unlocked via the lock integration that is created automatically for each vehicle. Before invoking these services, make sure itâ€™s safe to lock/unlock the vehicle in the current situation.</p>
<h3>Air condition</h3>
<p>The air condition of the vehicle can be activated with the service <code>bmw_connected_drive.activate_air_conditioning</code>.</p>
<p>What exactly is started here depends on the type of vehicle. It might range from just ventilation over auxiliary heating to real air conditioning. If your vehicle is equipped with auxiliary heating, only trigger this service if the vehicle is parked in a location where it is safe to use it (e.g., not in an underground parking or closed garage).</p>
<p>The vehicle is identified via the parameter <code>vin</code>.</p>
<h3>Sound the horn</h3>
<p>The service <code>bmw_connected_drive.sound_horn</code> sounds the horn of the vehicle. This option is not available in some countries (among which  the UK). Use this feature responsibly, as it might annoy your neighbors. The vehicle is identified via the parameter <code>vin</code>.</p>
<h3>Flash the lights</h3>
<p>The service <code>bmw_connected_drive.light_flash</code> flashes the lights of the vehicle. The vehicle is identified via the parameter <code>vin</code>.</p>
<h3>Update the state</h3>
<p>The service <code>bmw_connected_drive.update_state</code> fetches the last state of the vehicles of all your accounts from the BMW server. This does <em>not</em> trigger an update from the vehicle; it gets the data from the BMW servers. So this service does <em>not</em> interact with your vehicles.</p>
<p>This service does not require any attributes.</p>
