I":<p>Today we’re releasing Open Peer Power Companion for Android 1.5.0. This is a great release with some cool new features and new collaborators joining in on the fun!</p>
<p>Big thanks in this release goes to our Android lead <a href="https://github.com/JBassett">@JBassett</a> who has been squashing a ton of bugs, added support for the status bar to adopt the application theme and fixed finding existing Open Peer Power instances on the network.</p>
<p>A cool new feature that has been added is a new home screen widget. Use it to quickly trigger your favorite scripts, scenes or any other service in Open Peer Power. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/KBerstene">@KBerstene</a> for the initial implementation and <a href="https://github.com/JBassett">@JBassett</a> for polishing the configuration screen.</p>
<p>For all you people that want to run the Open Peer Power app on a tablet on the wall, good news! Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/neopilou">@neopilou</a> there is now a new option to make the app full screen.</p>
