Users of <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com"> Open Peer Power Cloud</a> can use the <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com/config/remote/">Remote UI</a> without requiring any configuration.
</div>
<p>If youâ€™re interested in logging in to Open Peer Power while away, youâ€™ll have to make your instance remotely accessible.</p>
<div class='note warning'>
<p>Remember to follow the <a href="/docs/configuration/securing/">securing checklist</a> before doing this.</p>
</div>
<div class='note'>
 Open Peer Power no longer support remote access via IP address since release 0.77, you have to use a domain name.
</div>
<p>The most common approach is to set up port forwarding (for any port) from your router to port 8123 on the computer that is hosting Open Peer Power. General instructions on how to do this can be found by searching <code>&lt;router model&gt; port forwarding instructions</code>. You can use any free port on your router and forward that to port 8123.</p>
<p>A problem with making a port accessible is that some Internet Service Providers only offer dynamic IPs. This can cause you to lose access to Open Peer Power while away. You can solve this by using a free Dynamic DNS service like <a href="https://www.duckdns.org/">DuckDNS</a>.</p>
<p>If you cannot access your Open Peer Power installation remotely, remember to check if your ISP provides you with a dedicated IP, instead of one shared with other users via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT">CG-NAT</a>. This is becoming fairly common nowadays due to the shortage of IPv4 addresses. Some, if not most ISPs will require you to pay an extra fee to be assigned a dedicated IPv4 address.</p>
<div class='note'>
<p>Just putting a port up is not secure. You should definitely consider encrypting your traffic if you are accessing your Open Peer Power installation remotely. For details please check the <a href="/blog/2017/09/27/effortless-encryption-with-lets-encrypt-and-duckdns/">set up encryption using Letâ€™s Encrypt</a> blog post or this <a href="/docs/ecosystem/certificates/lets_encrypt/">detailed guide</a> to using Letâ€™s Encrypt with Open Peer Power.</p>
</div>
<p>Protect your communication with a <a href="/docs/ecosystem/certificates/tls_self_signed_certificate/">self-signed certificate</a> between your client and the Open Peer Power instance.</p>
