## Improved entity handling on startup

We are now restoring all entities, stored in the registry,
on Open Peer Power startup.

During the startup of Open Peer Power, all your configured integrations are
loaded. Each of those integrations results in one or more devices
and entities. However, there was a catch!

The loading of some integrations could take a while, which caused some entities
not to be available immediately. Sometimes, this affected multiple things, like
missing devices in HomeKit/Google/Alexa or those big red boxes in our UI. We are sure, at some point, we've all experienced that.

As of this release, all these entities, if registered in our entity registry,
will be restored as "unavailable". That allows other parts of our system to use
them immediately, solving a lot of common issues during startup.

These restored entities can be differentiated from normal "unavailable" entities
by an additional state attribute added to those entities: "restored".

</p>

As a result, entities will no longer "disappear", so restored and unavailable
entities are removable, as shown in the screenshot above. Please note that,
if an integration provides an unavailable entity, the providing integration
needs to be removed first, or else, those entities can not be deleted.

## Ignore discovered devices & services

Got that one device that gets discovered over and over again?

It is now possible to ignore a specific discovered device with a single click!

<img src='/images/blog/2020-01-0.104/ignore-discovery.png' alt='Screenshot of a discovered Hue bridge'></a>

</p>

It requires the integration to be updated to support this. For this release,
the Hue, Axis, deCONZ, WLED and HomeKit integrations are updated to support
this new feature.

## Reload all the input things & bye generated groups

All [`input_*` integrations](/integrations/#search/input) now have a `reload`
service to reload your YAML configuration for these integrations, without
the need to restart Open Peer Power.

Furthermore, time to say bye-bye, to all generated entity groups
(`group.all_*`). Chances are, you have never heard of those because they were
hidden. However, if you rely on those groups for your automations, you
need to adjust those automations.
Check out the [breaking changes section](#breaking-changes) for more information.

## Multi-select entity management

Entity management has never been easier; It now allows for changing multiple
entities at once. Select multiple entities and remove, enable or disable them
with one click.

</p>

## ZHA configuration panel improvements

[@dmulcahey][@dmulcahey] did a lot of work on the ZHA config panel this release.

The navigation for the ZHA configuration panel has been redesigned to provide
a better user experience on mobile and desktop.

As part of the redesign, full Zigbee group management has been added, allowing
you to create and manage Zigbee groups right from the UI.

In a future releases, the ability to bind devices directly to groups,
will be added as well.

## Breaking Changes

- __Default groups__ - Entity integrations will no longer automatically maintain the hidden groups with all of their entities. The following groups are no longer automatically created and maintained:

  - `group.all_automations`
  - `group.all_covers`
  - `group.all_devices`
  - `group.all_fans`
  - `group.all_lights`
  - `group.all_locks`
  - `group.all_plants`
  - `group.all_remotes`
  - `group.all_scripts`
  - `group.all_switches`
  - `group.all_vacuum_cleaners`
  - `group.calendar`
  - `group.remember_the_milk_accounts`

  The automation and script configuration panels are updated to show and manage all automations/scripts. If you want to show cards in your UI with all entities for a single domain, use the auto-entities card. If you want to target all entities in a service call, use `all` as value for `entity_id`.

  ([@balloob] - [#23789]) ([automation docs]) ([calendar docs]) ([cover docs]) ([device_tracker docs]) ([fan docs]) ([light docs]) ([lock docs]) ([plant  docs]) ([remember_the_milk docs]) ([remote docs]) ([script docs]) ([switch docs]) ([vacuum docs]).

- __Hue__ - Hue will no longer import existing authentication from disk. It has not written this authentication to disk since March 2018. The config option has been deprecated and will be removed in 0.106. ([@balloob] - [#30000]) ([hue docs])

- __deCONZ__ - Due to changes to configuration handling, deCONZ groups will be assigned new identifiers in Open Peer Power. As a result, deCONZ groups will be duplicated. Remove any group devices from the registry prior to upgrading or alternatively delete the obsolete entries after the upgrade to eliminate the duplicates. ([#30875]) ([deconz docs])

- __UPnP__ - UPnP/IGD units of measurement have been aligned with other integrations and common uses, they're now kB and kB/s instead of kbyte and kbyte/sec respectively. - ([@scop] - [#29552]) ([upnp docs])

- __Worx Landroid__ - The `worxlandroid` sensor has been changed to not return the hardcoded state values `manual-stop`, `charging`, `charging-complete`, `going-home`, `mowing`, instead use the states given from the Landroid to Open Peer Power.

  This includes the state `idle`, which means that something is broken with the mower. You can use this as a notification to check the physical state of the mower.

  You need to update any automations that depend on the state of the sensor.

  ([@geraldhansen] - [#27453]) ([worxlandroid docs])

- __Apple iCloud__ - The iCloud component is no longer part of the device tracker platform and is now an integration, which is configurable via the UI. The iCloud cookie folder moved from `[HA_dir]/icloud` to `[HA_dir]/.storage/icloud`.- ([@Quentame] - [#28968]) ([icloud docs])

- __Pi-hole__ - The default value for `host` is removed, and now must be specified manually. - ([@johnluetke] - [#27569]) ([pi_hole docs])

    Example configuration:

  ```yaml
  pi_hole:
    - host: pi.hole
      ssl: false
    - host: backup.pi.hole
  ```

- __HERE Travel Time__ - HERE has deprecated the usage of `app_code` and new users can only generate an `api_key`. If you are already using HERE Travel Time, you have to follow the [migration guide](https://developer.here.com/documentation/authentication/dev_guide/topics/api-key-credentials.html) to retrieve the, now required, `api_key`. - ([@eifinger] - [#29966]) ([here_travel_time docs])

    Example configuration:

  ```yaml
  sensor:
    - platform: here_travel_time
      api_key: "YOUR_API_KEY"
      origin_latitude: "51.222975"
      origin_longitude: "9.267577"
      destination_latitude: "51.257430"
      destination_longitude: "9.335892"
  ```

- __ZHA__ - The default divisor for `active_power` has changed. Now, multiplier and divisor both default to 1 if the device does not support these attributes or when getting those attributes from the device fails. - ([@Adminiuga] - [#30130]) ([zha docs])

- __Keba__ - The unique_ids of the entities have changed and are now more future proof. The default `name` and `entity_id` of the entities have also changed. You need to clear stale entries from the entity registry and update concerned automations and scripts. - ([@dannerph] - [#30125]) ([keba docs])

- __Tesla__ - Config flow has been added for Tesla. Device tracker entity names have changed due to this. They now follow the naming convention of the rest of the Tesla entities. The `id` device tracker entity attribute was also removed because it is a duplicate of `trackr_id`. - ([@alandtse] - [#28744]) ([tesla docs])
- __Huawei LTE__ - The Huawei LTE notify service name is now configurable. The default name for the Huawei LTE notify service has changed to `notify.huawei_lte` to avoid conflicts with other notify services. An option to provide a name for the service has also been added. - ([@scop] - [#30208]) ([huawei_lte docs])

   Example configuration:

   ```yaml
   huawei_lte:
     - url: ...
       password: ...
       notify:
         name: sms
   ```

- __Amcrest__ *(Removed)* - Amcrest sensors and switches that were deprecated in previous releases have now been removed. - ([@pnbruckner] - [#30308]) ([amcrest docs])

   Example configuration:

   ```yaml
   amcrest:
   - ...
     sensors:
       # This sensor type is no longer supported and must be removed.
       - motion_detector
     # All switch types are no longer supported and must be removed.
     switches:
       - motion_detection
       - motion_recording
   ```

- __MQTT__ - Added separate command and state topics for the MQTT lock. Two new properties are introduced with `state_locked` (default: LOCKED) and `state_unlocked` (default: UNLOCKED). If you are using the same topic as `state_topic` as for the `command_topic` you can reestablish the old behavior by setting `state_locked` to *LOCK* and `state_unlocked` to *UNLOCK*. Effectively, this change allows you to distinguish commands and states in two topics with different values. - ([@tuxbox] - [#29808]) ([mqtt docs])

   Example configuration:

   ```yaml
   lock:
     - platform: mqtt
       command_topic: "/dev/ha/lock/cmd"
       state_topic:   "/dev/ha/lock/state"
       value_template: "{{ value_json.state }}"
       state_locked: "locked"
       state_unlocked: "unlocked"
   ```

- __LG webOS Smart TV__ - The component setup now uses the `webostv` domain instead of `media_player`. The host configuration option is now required and the timeout and filename options have been removed. The state handling for webOStv has also been cleaned up. An entity will have `on` when the tv is on instead of `playing` or `paused` as was previously the case. You need to update automations that depend on the entity state. - ([@bendavid] - [#29296] [#30416]) ([webostv docs])

     Example configuration:

     ```yaml
     webostv:
         name: LG TV
         host: 192.168.1.53
         #other settings
         turn_on_action:
             service: wake_on_lan.send_magic_packet
             data:
               mac: "00:00:00:00:00:00"
         standby_connection: true
     ```

- __Axis__ - Axis integration will no longer accept manual configuration of devices, all configuration of the Axis integration will now be handled from the integrations panel. - ([@Kane610] - [#30365]) ([axis docs])

  TL;DR This will no longer work:

  ```yaml
  axis:
  ```

- __WLED__ - Improved WLED pure white support for RGBW LED strips. When using WLED with RGBW strips, setting the color in Open Peer Power to white, will turn off the RGB LEDs of the strip and use the W channel only. - ([@frenck] - [#30477]) ([wled docs])

- __Timer__ - Fire restarted event on restarting an active timer. This can break automations that should trigger on every timer start event. - ([@mnigbur] - [#30475]) ([timer docs])

- __Vizio__ - Removed `suppress_warning` from configuration options for Vizio integration. The `pyvizio` package now suppresses insecure HTTPS request warnings in a way that doesn't affect global requests from other integrations or Open Peer Power itself. There is no need to globally suppress insecure warnings now. - ([@raman325] - [#30536]) ([vizio docs])

  Example configuration:

  ```yaml
  media_player:
    - platform: vizio
      host: '<IP>:<PORT>'
      access_token: '<AUTH_TOKEN>'
      device_class: tv
  ```

- __RFXtrx__ - Bump pyRFXtrx to 0.25. This update switches the commands for `open` and `close` for RFXtrx covers of the "Rollertrol" type, as they were switched (clicking open resulted in closing of the cover and vice versa). Existing automations should be updated. - ([@Ernst79] - [#30566]) ([rfxtrx docs])

- __Ring__ - Ring is now configurable via a config entry. This means it will no longer store the username and password and you're able to configure accounts that use 2FA. It's no longer possible to set scan interval, monitored conditions or FFmpeg arguments. The defaults are used. - ([@balloob] - [#30564]) ([ring docs])

- __Binary Sensor (Locks)__ - Updated ON/OFF condition and triggers to match the documentation and UI. This change inverts the logic of automations relating to binary sensor with the `lock` device class, but only for automations triggering on the lock state (rather than triggering a lock/unlock action).

  If you already created automations, you will need to check those, as they probably need to be inverted. The text displayed in the trigger or condition dropdowns will now be correct.

  One possible scenario is if you have set an automation using the state of one lock to trigger an action on other lock(s). This change would cause the action to trigger on `locking` if it was previously triggering on `unlocking`. - ([@davet2001] - [#30663]) ([binary_sensor docs])

- __Google Assistant__ - The `api_key` for manual installs is now deprecated and will be removed in 0.105.  To correct this you will need to remove `api_key` from the `configuration.yaml` and switch to using `service_account` instead. - ([@elupus] - [#30402]) ([google_assistant docs])
